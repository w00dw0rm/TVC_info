* Introduction
  
A study has been conducted that asked users to produce storyboards to understand the impact of using different peripherals to control virtual cameras in virtual scenes. As an expert you're invited to rate their storyboards. The participants have a wide range of filming and virtual environment experience 
 
The participants were given a blank 9-shot storyboard along with the script to use. They were asked to create at least one, ideally 2â€“3 storyboards within 15 minutes by moving a virtual camera within a virtual film set using one of two interfaces. They then repeated the task with the other interface. No training was given, other than that of how to manipulate the virtual camera using the two interfaces. The purpose of rating the storyboards is to determine if there is a material difference between the two interfaces. As such which interface was used to create each storyboard will not be revealed to you.
 
The storyboards will be presented to you in a random order, and you are to rate them according to the sliders. Please try to rate all images presented. Your progress will be shown in the progress bar. It is expected this task will take approximately 2 hours. 


* The script
  
Only 1 script (a conversation between 2 people) was used throughout the entire study, which is noted here for reference:

"MAN: Well, he knows a little about me."

"WOMAN: You didn't tell him your name, did ya?"

"MAN: I told him my first name, and where I'm from."

"There is a long silence and a blank look from WOMAN, then she SCREAMS:"

"WOMAN: Why!"

"MAN: I told him where I was from a few days ago.  It was just a casual conversation."

"WOMAN: And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?"

"MAN: He asked."

"WOMAN looks at MAN with contempt "


* The 3D environment

The virtual 3D environment used was a fictional location with indoor spaces, outdoor spaces, and 4 characters. The user had control of the camera position only, with no lens / aperture / lighting / object control, and could focus on any of the characters in the scene. A minority of users may have moved the characters if they felt the desire to do so, in order to achieve particular framing. The scene was static, with no moving objects. THe user could not control focal distance, or the render quality of the scene. As such, some images may appear pixelated, which should not be marked negatively. 


The video below shows the environment:

* The scoring terms:

For assistance in understanding what each term means, refer to the below:

** Visually pleasing: ** Do the images have novel  framing, convey beauty, or are different from 'the norm'?

** Readability: ** Do the images convey the story appropriately? Would someone understand the story without seeing the script?
 
** Professionalism: ** Are traditional filming rules upheld (e.g. 180 degree rule, minimum angle violation etc.)? Given the limited control the users had (camera position only), are the framing and composition of images of a professional manner?
