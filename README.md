* Introduction
A study has been conducted that asked users to produce storyboards to understand the impact of using different peripherals to control virtual cameras in virtual scenes. As an expert you're invited to rate their storyboards. The participants have a wide range of filming and virtual environment experience 
 
The participants were given a blank 9-shot storyboard along with the script to use. They were asked to create at least one, ideally 2â€“3 storyboards within 15 minutes by moving a virtual camera within a virtual film set using one of two interfaces. They then repeated the task with the other interface. No training was given, other than that of how to manipulate the virtual camera using the two interfaces. The purpose of rating the storyboards is to determine if there is a material difference between the two interfaces. As such which interface was used to create each storyboard will not be revealed to you.
 
The storyboards will be presented to you in a random order, and you are to rate them according to the sliders. Please try to rate all images presented. Your progress will be shown in the progress bar. It is expected this task will take approximately 2 hours.
